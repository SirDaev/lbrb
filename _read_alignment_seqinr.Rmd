# Read MSA file 

## Reading a multiple alignment file into R

To read a sequence alignment into R from a file, you can use the read.alignment() function in the SeqinR package. For example, to read in the multiple sequence alignment of the virus phosphoproteins into R, we type:

```{r, eval = F}
virusaln  <- read.alignment(file = "phosphoproteins.phy", format = "phylip")
```

The virusaln variable is a list variable that stores the alignment.

An R list variable can have named elements, and you can access the named elements of a list variable by typing the variable name, followed by “$”, followed by the name of the named element.

The list variable virusaln has named elements “nb”, “nam”, “seq”, and “com”.

In fact, the named element “seq” contains the alignment, which you can view by typing:

```{r, eval = F}
virusaln$seq
```

Only the first part of the alignment stored in virusaln$seq is shown here, as it is very long.
