# Test audio link

Here is an example of an audio link  embedded in a bookdown book.

The link is here:
https://www.genome.gov/sites/default/files/tg/en/narration/single_nucleotide_polymorphisms_snps.mp3

In HTML bookdown renders it like this:

```{r eval=knitr::is_html_output(), echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_url("https://www.genome.gov/sites/default/files/tg/en/narration/single_nucleotide_polymorphisms_snps.mp3",
                   height = "100px")
```

(In PDF there is a way to render just a screen shot and link, I think).
