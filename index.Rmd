# Preface to version 2.0 {-}

Welcome to *A Little Book of R for Bioinformatics 2.0*!.

This book is based on the original [*A Little Book of R for Bioinformatics*](https://a-little-book-of-r-for-bioinformatics.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) by Dr. Avril Coghlan (Hereafter "ALBRB 1.0").  Dr. Coghlan's book was one of the first and most thorough introductions to using R for bioinformatics, and was generously published under the Creative Commons 3.0 Attribution License [(CC BY 3.0)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/).  In addition to describing how to do bioinformatics in R, Coghlan provided numerous functions to facilitate important tasks, practice questions, and references to further reading. 

[ALBRB 1.0](https://a-little-book-of-r-for-bioinformatics.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) was extremely useful to me when I was learning bioinformatics and computational biology.  In this version of the book, which I'll refer to as ALBRB 2.0, I have adapted Dr. Coghlan's original book to suit my own teaching needs.  


Below I've outlined the general types of changes I've made to the original book.  I have tried to link back to the original content that these updates are derived from and note how changes were made.  Any errors or inconsistencies should be ascribed to me, not Dr. Coghlan.  If you have any feedback, please email me at brouwern@gmail.com

**Changes implemented in ALBRB 2.0 by Nathan Brouwer**

1. Converted the entire book to RMarkdown and published it via bookdown.
1. Added instructions for using RStudio and RStudio Cloud.
1. Updated instructions to reflect any changes in software, including changes to how the bioinformatics  repository Bioconductor now works.
1. Split up chapters into smaller units.
1. Reorganized the order of some material.
1. Added links to the book I am developing, *Computational Biology for All*.
1. Moved most functions and datasets to my teaching package [compbio4all](https://github.com/brouwern/compbio4all).
1. Changed some plotting to ggplot2 or ggpubr.
1. Added additional subheadings
1. Added vocab and function lists to the beginning of many chapters
1. At times replaced non-biological examples with biological ones.
1. Change from British to American English (Sorry!Couldn't help myself.)
1. Provided additional links to external resources.
1. Added use or `rentrez` for querying NCBI databases

<!-- rentrez replaces what? Seqinr?-->
