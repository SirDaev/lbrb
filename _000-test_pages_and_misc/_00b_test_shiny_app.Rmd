# Test shiny app

Here is an example of a Shiny app (treesiftr) embedded in a bookdown book.

The direct link is [here](https://wrightaprilm.shinyapps.io/treesiftr_app/):
https://wrightaprilm.shinyapps.io/treesiftr_app/

It may take a few seconds for the app to appear (its a fairly big one I think)

```{r  eval=knitr::is_html_output(), echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_app(url = "https://wrightaprilm.shinyapps.io/treesiftr_app/")
```
